## üí° Key Concepts

### India's Digital Revolution

#### The Foundation Years (1986-2000)

India's digital journey began with the introduction of the first Indian computers in 1986. These early machines, though basic by today's standards, marked India's entry into the digital age. In 1995, VSNL (Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited) made history by bringing Internet services to India for the first time, connecting the nation to the global digital network. During this period, pioneering Indian IT companies like Infosys, TCS, and Wipro were established, laying the groundwork for India's future as a technology hub.

#### Digital Growth (2000-2015)

The new millennium saw mobile phones transform from luxury items to everyday necessities, with millions of Indians getting their first taste of mobile connectivity. Internet cafes sprouted in neighborhoods across cities and towns, becoming digital community centers where people could access the Internet, check emails, and learn computer skills. The government also began its e-governance initiatives, starting to digitize public services and records to improve efficiency and accessibility.

#### Digital India (2015-Present)

The JAM Trinity revolutionized digital inclusion by connecting Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar identification, and Mobile connectivity, bringing millions of Indians into the formal financial system. The UPI (Unified Payments Interface) sparked a payments revolution, making digital transactions as simple as sending a message. Meanwhile, the Digital Villages initiative is bridging the urban-rural digital divide by bringing high-speed Internet, digital literacy programs, and e-services to rural India.
