### Previously You Learned

_This is the first module, so we'll start fresh with no prerequisites!_

## 🤔 Have You Ever Wondered...

- How does a video call connect you with someone halfway across the world in an instant?
- Why does everything stop working when your phone says "no internet"?
- How does your favorite content—like memes or games—reach you so quickly?

Get ready to uncover the magic behind the **Internet**—the invisible network that connects billions of devices globally!

## 🎯 In This Lesson

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- Understand what the Internet really is (spoiler: it’s not just websites).
- Learn how devices communicate across vast distances.
- Explore how the Internet connects to your home.
- Discover why the Internet is like a global information playground.

## 🧪 Let’s Dive In!

Imagine you’re sending a birthday card to your best friend who lives in another city:

1. You write the card, seal it in an envelope, and write their address.
2. You drop it into a postbox.
3. The post office ensures it reaches your friend through a complex network of sorting centers, vehicles, and postal workers.

Now imagine doing this instantly—but instead of just a card, you’re sharing photos, videos, or even gaming together! That’s the Internet’s job. But instead of postboxes and delivery trucks, it uses **computers, cables, and wireless signals** to deliver information at lightning speed.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### What is the Internet?

The Internet is a **gigantic network of networks**—like a massive spider web connecting millions of computers, phones, and devices worldwide. These devices communicate using special rules called **protocols**.

### How Does the Internet Work?

Just like we use roads to travel, the Internet has its own “highways” for data. Here's how it works:

1. **Physical Connections**: Special cables run under streets, oceans, and across countries, connecting different parts of the world.
2. **Wireless Signals**: Wi-Fi, mobile data, and satellites send information through invisible waves in the air.
3. **Routers and Switches**: These devices act like traffic signals, directing data to the correct destination.
